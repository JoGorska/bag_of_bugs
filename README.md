# Bag of Bugs
e-commerce application to manage the stock of the shop that is selling bugs. 

## list available products:
http://127.0.0.1:8000/species/
http://127.0.0.1:8000/species/size/
http://127.0.0.1:8000/species/enviroment/
http://127.0.0.1:8000/species/category/

this needs to list all species - list of all bugs. These are the items available for the user to purchase.



than I need to check how much of each specie I have in stock - by going into stock item model.



instead of getting code from random it would be good to generate qr code for each stock item.
